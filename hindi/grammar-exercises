Language level: basic (A2)
Number of questions: 5
Types of questions: Cloze. For example (in English): "This is the kind _____ test where a word _____ omitted from a passage every so often. The candidate must _____ the gaps, usually the first two lines are without gaps.", and I would have to fill in the blanks

Also please add the same number of questions on some other grammar topics.

Do not include the answers to the questions in your reply. My next prompt will be answering your questions. You will correct my answers and give me a final grade out of 100. For any grammar errors, please offer an explanation explaining what the error was.
