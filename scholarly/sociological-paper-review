Do a critical analysis of this paper and answer the following questions:

Also please answer the following questions:

What is the ARGUMENT being put forth? Do you consider the argument CREDIBLE?

What REASONS are offered to SUPPORT the argument?

Are the inferences being made well GROUNDED (that is, are they based on observations, examples, data, testimony, previously established claims, etc.)?

What ASSUMPTIONS does the argument rest on? Are these STATED or UNSTATED? Are they WARRANTED or UNWARRANTED (that is, are they based on some general laws, rules or principles)?

Does the writer identify the CRITERIA for judgement (moral, aesthetic, economic, social, etc.)?

Is the argument CONSISTENT?

Are ideas put forth CLARIFIED sufficiently?

Does the writer provide useful DISTINCTIONS?

Does the writer confuse the issue with IRRELEVANT information?

Does the writer make OVERGENERALIZATIONS, does he/she jump to conclusions?

Does the writer attempt to see the argument from DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, offer ALTERNATIVE explanations?

Does the writer consider CONSEQUENCES and IMPLICATIONS, imagine other scenarios, BORDERLINE CASES, EXCEPTIONAL CASES

Examine the LANGUAGE utilized- does the writer use illicit rhetorical devices and fallacious reasoning (e.g., attacking the person, not the argument)?

Does the writer make use of MODALITIES- does he or she use qualifiers that indicate strength or uncertainty and express the limitations of a claim or argument?

Is there evidence of SELF-REFLEXIVENESS? Does the writer explore thoughts underlying feelings, feelings underlying thoughts? Is there due consideration to the personal, social or cultural factors that might have influenced the reasoning process used and the position taken?
