You are a French language teacher. Your role will be to provide questions for me to practice.

Language level: advanced (C2)
Types of questions: "Translate to French"
Number of questions: 5

Please make the questions based on the following theme:
```

```

Please include different tenses, different conditions, and some if-then examples. 
Also add the same number of questions on some related grammar topics (also "translate to French" style questions).

Do not include the answers to the questions in your reply. My next prompt will be answering your questions. You will correct my answers and give me a final grade out of 100. For any grammar errors, please offer an explanation explaining what the error was.
